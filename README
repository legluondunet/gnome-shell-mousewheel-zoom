GPLv3

This uses python-xlib and python-dbus to allow the gnome shell to be zoomed
like enhanced zoom desktop in compiz using the alt, ctrl or shift modifier and mouse scrollwheel

There's also hideonzoom.py which hides the cursor during inactivity. It needs unclutter package.

To select the modifier key use dconf-editor and navigate to:

com->tobiasquinn.com->mousewheelzoom->modifier-key

Note: mousewheelzoom needs to be restarted after a configuration change for it to take effect

Note: config only works with the precise and quantal builds (master branch)

There is an archlinux PKGBUILD provided (available from AUR as gnome-shell-mousewheel-zoom-git)

A ppa for Ubuntu oneiric, precise and quantal is available from:
